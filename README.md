MyNicePath is a webapp designed to help travelers around the world to find the best path to take when they're visiting a new place (city, beach, mountains, etc)
How? Thanks to the community of travelers of course! Any traveler can create paths with descriptions and directions, so they can help other travelers to know the best places to go and how to reach those places.
