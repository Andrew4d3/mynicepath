# mynicepath

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

MyNicePath is a webapp designed to help travelers around the world to find the best path to take when they're visiting a new place (city, beach, mountains, etc)
How? Thanks to the community of travelers of course! Any traveler can create paths with descriptions and directions, so they can help other travelers to know the best places to go and how to reach those places.

This webapp was created in order to particate in the 2016 Hack.Submit() hackaton sponsored by Pluralsight and Koding. It was created in less than 48 hours so you might expect to find some bad coding here and bad practices that I would never consider to do in a production project.
